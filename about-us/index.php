                           For centuries, garnet was used primarily as a semi-precious gemstone. Aside from the aesthetic beauty of this mineral, the angular fractures and high hardness of garnet has led to the stone becoming desirable for a variety of industrial applications. Major uses for garnet in the industrial sector include water-jet cutting, abrasive blasting media, water filtration and abrasive powders. According to the U.S. Geological Survey Minerals Yearbook, worldwide industrial garnet demand is expected to grow over the next 5 years at a rate of 3-5 percent. While the United States is the world's largest consumer of industrial garnet, it only produces approximately 16 percent of the total garnet mined worldwide.

                                        Alder Gulch became famous as one of the richest gold placer gulches with the first discovery in 1863, during the Civil War. The present dredge tailings were a result of several episodes of dredge mining of gold beginning in 1889 near the present plant site of Ruby Garnet. Conrey Placer Mining Company mined approximately 100 million tons of alluvium from 1899 to 1922.

                                        Cominco bought rights to some of the tailings in 1989 and conducted a sampling program (including the drilling of 17 RC holes), benefaction studies, pilot plant tests and marketing studies. Construction of the plant started in 1994 and first production was achieved in 1996 from tailings adjacent to the plant. Production continued, except for winter shutdown during freezing conditions, but the operation was sold to Montana-Oregon Investment Group, LLC in 1999. Production stopped in 2002 while a buyer was sought, and in 2004 Ruby Valley Garnet, LLC bought the operation and started mining garnet on a seasonal basis from alluvium in Red Wash. In November of 2011 Garnet USA purchased the plant as well as a mineral hard rock deposit commonly called section 25.
