                                        Garnets are often mined in open-pit mines. 
                                        In an open-pit mine the soil and mineral deposits 
                                        are removed using dump trucks with large bucket 
                                        shovels. Open-pit mines are often used to retrieve 
                                        shallow deposits of garnet. After the dirt over the 
                                        mineral deposits is removed roads are built down the 
                                        sides of the pit so that trucks can get to the bottom 
                                        where they are filled with deposits containing garnets 
                                        which are then taken to a processing facility.
