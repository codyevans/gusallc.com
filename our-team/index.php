                                        As the fifth generation on a family farm in the Appalachian mountains of Western 
                                        North Carolina we raised cattle, horses, goats, rabbits, waterfowl and chickens.
                                        I began using heavy equipment on the farm at a young age and also stone masonry since my 
                                        stepfather was a stonemason and house builder.  Some of my experience is as follows:  welder,
                                        heavy equipment operator, dump truck driver, log skidder operator, tractor trailer driver, 
                                        crane operator, various types of welding equipment, machinist equipment, aggregate sorting/separating 
                                        plant operator. I have extensive experience as a welder and machinist, electrician, and two years of experience as a quarry supervisor.

                                        When the quarry was closed I moved to Montana and purchased Alder Market and also worked as a cowboy on a local ranch.  
                                        Currently, I am general foreman of the Garnet USA mine operations in Alder, MT

                                     I was born and raised in California.  After graduation from high school 
                                     I enlisted in the United States Air Force as a security forces member and 
                                     was stationed in Texas, Guam and the Azores. While I was stationed overseas, 
                                     I completed a program for a certificate in business and marketing. Upon my return 
                                     to the United States I moved to Seattle, Washington where I lived for 6 years. 
                                     I moved to Montana in 2011. Prior to my employment at Strategic Minerals, I worked 
                                     for six years as an administrative assistant with various organizations. I have been 
                                     blessed with two wonderful children a daughter, Kira who is six and a son, Kannyon who 
                                     is one. I enjoy spending time with my children, baking, traveling, and being outdoors.
